# Drupal as a CMS framework

--vv--

# Drupal framework
- Drupal core = framework + UI + features
- Common CMS features included.
- Request handling: page load, caching
- Accounts: users, login, permissions, sessions
- Database: database abstraction, pluggable entity, variable and cache storage
- Menu's, forms, extensions, theming.

# Best practices
- Build with contributed modules.
- DON'T HACK CORE!
- Custom modules are often _glue code_, sometimes independent functionality.
- Use the framework voor ease and security.
