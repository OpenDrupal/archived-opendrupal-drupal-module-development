Custom configuration entity - Exercise 2
Estimated time: 45 minutes.

As site owner I want to gather data from various URLs. From each URL I want different types data to be collected.

==== Step 1 ====
Use endpoint data from the configuration entity to show DOM data on the diagnostic page.
- Load a single endpoint entity on the test page from exercise 1.
- Use the data from the endpoint to call the HTML fetcher and parser(s).

==== Step 2 ====
Create additional plugins and call multiple endpoint with them.
- Rewrite the code of the page controller to load each endpoint entity.
- For each endpoint apply the selected processors and display the parsed data.

==== Step 3 ====
Add a dedicated permission to the Endpoint configuration entity.
- Create a permission 'Administer OpenDrupal crawler'.
- Use the permission for administration of the content entity.
- Use the permission for the page too.
- Check the result.
