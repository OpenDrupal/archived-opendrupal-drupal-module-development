Exercises to create a custom block with a list of items.
Estimated time: 30 min.

==== Step 1 ====
Create a module for game review functionality.
- Create an od_pegi directory inside modules/custom
- Create an od_pegi.info.yml file with the required information
- Alternatively you can use `drush generate module`
- Enable the module.

==== Step 2 ====
Set up the @Block annotation.
- Find a block class in core that can be used as an example. (But not in the
  Block module).
- Find and read the interfaces that are implemented by BlockBase.
- Copy the provided Block class to src/Plugin/Block inside the og_pegi module. 
- Complete the @Block annotation:
  - Use the documentation sources provided in the presentation slide.
  - Annotation keys are documented in: \Drupal\Core\Block\Annotation\Block.
- Clear the cache. The block name should now appear in the list of available
  blocks when you place a block in a region at the Block layout page.

==== Step 3 ====
Complete the build() method and enable the block.
- Read the code that is currently used in the build() method.
- Modify the code to return a list of dummy strings.
- Place the block in the sidebar and check the result.
