Custom configuration entity - Exercise 1
Estimated time: 90 minutes.

As site owner I want to gather data from various URLs. From each URL I want
different types data to be collected.

==== Step 1 ====
Create a basic configuration entity for crawler endpoints.
- Create a configuration entity that stores the endpoints that will be crawled.
  - This includes:
    - Entity definition (Class: Endpoint)
    - Forms to add/edit/delete the entity.
    - Overview page with list of endpoints
  - Either use Drush or Drupal Console, or copy the files from
    configuration-entity/od_crawler/* in this exercise folder.
- Modify the Endpoint class so that it stores:
  - ID: Unique ID for each endpoint
  - Label: The human readlable name of the endpoint
  - URL: The URL of the endpoint
- Modify the forms and the overview page to match the stored data.
- Add methods to the Endpoint class for:
  - The endpoint URL
- Add the method(s) to the EndpointInterface.
- Create one or two endpoint entities to check the result.

==== Step 2 ====
Extend the configuration entity to handle the HTML processors.
- Extend the configuration entity to store one or more HTML processors that can
  be applied to the endpoint DOM data.
  - The entity should store multiple IDs of HTML processors per endpoint.
- Modify the forms for this data.
- Add a method for:
  - The processors for this endpoint
  - A list of available endpoints.
- Add the method(s) to the EndpointInterface.
- Create an endpoint to check the result.
