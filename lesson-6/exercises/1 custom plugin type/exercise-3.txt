# Custom plugin type - Exercise 3
Estimated time: 90 minutes.

As site owner I want to gather various types of data from the sites.
Types of data: H1 tag, Page language, Processor meta tag

- Determine the scope and the functionality of the plugin.
  - What is the overall functionality?
  - What role does the plugin play in it?
- Determine the interface of the plugin.
  - What data will the plugin receive, in which form?
  - What data will the plugin return, in which form?
- Write the (pseudo) code in the parser service that calls the plugin and
  handles the return data.
- Create a plugin manager for annotation type plugins. 
  - This includes:
    - Annotation definition class (extends Drupal\Component\Annotation\Plugin).
    - Plugin manager and its interface (class: HtmlProcessor;
      name: html_processor).
    - Plugin base class (extends Drupal\Component\Plugin\PluginBase)
  - Either use Drush or Drupal Console, or copy the files from
    plugin/od_crawler/* in this exercise folder.
- Write the first plugin.
  - Call a plugin from the parser service to check the result.
- Evaluate and rework
  - Does the plugin match the interface design and the overall functionality?
  - Is the interface re-usable for other plugins?
  - Is the OO structure correct and not over-designed?
