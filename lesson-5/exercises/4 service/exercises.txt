Contains exercises to create a service.
Estimated time: 15 minutes.

==== Step 1 ====
Define a service that fetches HTML data.
- Determine how Drupal performs an HTML GET request.
- Use the od_crawler.services.yml file provided in this exercise, and
  the hints below.
- Define a service in the od_crawler.services.yml file that loads and
  processes HTML data using Drupal core's http client. Use the HtmlLoader*.php
  files in src that are provided in this exercise.
- Note that this service uses the http client included in Drupal core.

--- Hints for step 1 ---
- arguments
- class
- Drupal\od_crawler\HtmlLoader
- http_client
- services
- od_crawler.html_loader

==== Step 2 ====
Create a test page to show the fetched data.
- Create a controller class and router. Choose your own URL and title.
- Implement a method loadHtml() in the service from step 1 that fetches HTML
  data from an endpoint.
- Display some HTML returned by the service on the page.

==== Step 3 ====
Get DOM data of the HTML response.
- Use the service from the first exercise step.
- Add a constructor to load the parser.
- Implement HtmlLoader::loadDom() that returns an HtmlDocument object of the
  endpoint data. Note that the interface already contains the method definition.
- Find a way to test this new method.
